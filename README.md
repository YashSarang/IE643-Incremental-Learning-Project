Class Expansion in  Pre-trained Models : Updation of a pre-trained model (final-layer based),  if new classes come in the target dataset.

For the Inteface, 
please run app.py from Demonstration folder
cd to the folder and execute
"streamlit run app.py"

Note. It will access your local machine's GPU, hence I have implemented only 5 Epochs and only the Final_Layer_Retraining model, which takes lower computation.
Other models can be found in the Code Files folder.

Work Post Intensive Assesment contains the implementation of Geometric Analysis approach:
Please refer to Updated-Work.docx for further clarification on the same.
